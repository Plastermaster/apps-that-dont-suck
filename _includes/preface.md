As someone who owns both a desktop and laptop with Windows 8, I want my programs to be consistent between the two. This might take some planning so I'd might as well turn it into a thread or something for other people to use.

Hopefully it'll be useful for you guys somehow.

Feel free to discuss the programs listed and/or recommend your own additions to the list.

I'm busy these days, but I'll try to update the list according to the comments when possible.

Here are all the programs and websites I can think of that are useful.

#### P.S.

_I don't have all these programs on my computer at once (are you goddamn nuts!?) but it really is a compilation of programs I've used at one point or another._

_Some programs maybe just be alternatives to others just to give you a choice._

_I'll definitely update the thread later with links, make it more organized, look nicer, and all that to make life easier._

_Maybe I'll make a banner or some shit, I don't know. The formatting really does look like crap right now._

_Also I remember there being another thread with this long list of useful websites, if someone could find that it would be nice, so I can link it or something._

_Of course, the list isn't perfect, so I'd like some second opinions so I can improve it in the future._
